## Setup
Run `startupWalkingRobot.m` to get the MATLAB path ready

There are 4 main folders containing the various walking robot examples

1. `ModelingSimulation` -- Shows how to build the simulation of the walking 
robot, including contact forces, various actuator models, and importing from CAD.

2. `Optimization` -- Shows how to use genetic algorithms to optimize joint angle
trajectories for stability and speed.

3. `ControlDesign` -- Shows how to create closed-loop walking controllers 
using common techniques like Zero Moment Point (ZMP) manipulation and 
Model Predictive Control (MPC) for pattern generation.

4. `ReinforcementLearning` -- Shows how to set up and train a Deep Deterministic 
Policy Gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning agent for learning how to walk.

Each of these folders has its own separate README with more information.
